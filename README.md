# FossifyMyUrl
Replies to messages that contain links with links to privacy-respecting FOSS alternative frontends.

Requires discord.js **v13** (because v14 makes barely any sense.)
You'll also need to install dotenv, typescript & linkifyjs.
In theory, you should also be able to install these using `npm update`.

## Configuring FossifyMyUrl
You can change frontend settings using the Frontends.json file. Other options can be found in the Fossify.json file.
